# DM&E

Welcome to my first ever GitHub project! ðŸŽ‰

This is a glowing, animated HTML & CSS visual experiment called **DM&E** â€” short for **Dimpho Magoro & Energy**. It's a creative playground where I explore cool animations, glowing effects, and unique design using HTML and CSS.

## ðŸŒŸ What's inside?

- ðŸ”¤ Custom font (`CoolFont`)
- ðŸŒ€ Glowing animated blobs (5 colorful shapes)
- ðŸ’¡ Clean, dark background
- ðŸ’¾ No JavaScript â€” just pure HTML & CSS magic

## ðŸš€ How to run it

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
